## JSP + Angular based Web Components minimal POC
1) Start the app with `./gradlew appStart`.
2) Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/micro.jsp` to see the POC.

## Tips
If you wish to tinker with the Angular files found inside the `client` 
folder then make sure to execute the `./bundle-up` script after making changes.
This will rebuild the Angular-based Web Components and make them available for
the JSP.
